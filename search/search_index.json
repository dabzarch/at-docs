This no longer requires users to locate the template on the server, instead, simply open Revit, go to \u2018File\u2019 \u2018New\u2019 \u2013 and select \u2018Architype Template\u2019. Architype\u2019s Revit Template is a read-only document and must not be edited by any member of staff. The template contains preloaded Detail Items, Filled Regions, View Templates, Worksets and Basic Wall/Floor/Roof Types. It also contains predefined Text Types, Line Styles and Browser Organisation. This is done to speed up the process of starting a new project and ensures that there are examples of correct naming within the project. The template will be regularly updated to ensure compliance with current BS EN ISO Standards. If a high standard view template, detail component etc, has been created which works well and may be of value to others, then contact one of Architype\u2019s Information Management team to have it inserted into the next revision of the template. Coordinate system \u00b6 All Revit models shall use a consistent and uniform coordinate system throughout the project\u2019s lifecycle to ensure information is always precisely aligned. Shared coordinates should only be acquired from a separate site model i.e. you should create a geolocated site model from a survey to share with all other disciplines. The main building is then modelled in a separate Revit file. This will make it easier for other consultants to acquire coordinates, it is also easier if the building needs to move. Survey Point \u00b6 The survey point identifies a real-world location near the model, such as a corner of the project site or the intersection of 2 property lines. It defines the origin of the survey coordinate system, which provides a real-world context for the model. Project Base Point \u00b6 The project base point defines the origin (0,0,0) of the project coordinate system, used as a reference point for measurements across the site. Where there are gridlines in a project, the preference is to place the Project Base Point at the intersection of grid A-1. Internal Origin (or Start-up Location): \u00b6 The internal origin is the starting point for the internal coordinate system, which provides the basis for positioning all elements in the model. The location of the internal origin never moves. It\u2019s the origin from which the survey point (and real-world context) and project base point are established. The following table is included within Architype\u2019s standard BIM Execution Plan (BEP) \u2013 and, where we are employed as BIM Manager, this will need to be filled in by the project team at the start of the project. Project Units \u00b6 It is important to use consistent units and measurement across the project. Default project units shall be as below. Note: temporary dimensions (such as the below screenshot) will display with decimal places. Setting up the Project Browser \u00b6 Sheets \u00b6 Sheets should be organised in Revit through their numbering, sorting them into View Group & Sub View Group. For more information on numbering, see Section 4.2. \u2018View Group\u2019 : indicates the series number \u2018Sub View Group\u2019 : indicates the sub series number These can be found, and edited, in the properties bar of a selected sheet or view. In order to set up this organisation at the start of a project, follow these steps: Views \u00b6 Revit views are categorised into: 01 Working (day-to-day working views) 02 Drawing Set (views which are on sheets) 03 Presentation (views to be taken into other pieces of software for presentation) 04 Coordination (views to assist with coordination, i.e. overlaying imported models) Note: Within 01 Working category you can put your initials at the end of the view name to let other team members know you are working on this particular view. When you are done or no longer need the view it should be deleted. To ensure that the project browser stays as organised as possible, views from the \u201802 Drawing Set\u2019 should be placed on sheets as soon as possible. Once they are on sheets they will be automatically removed from the browser and accessed only through the sheets. This keeps the project browser tidy and makes sure that drawings are always developed in the context of a sheet. Although this process is incorporated into the Architype Template, for those working in projects already set up on previous templates, the process below can be followed. Creating a Cloud Model \u00b6 The majority of project Revit models will be stored on BIM360, certainly any project with more than one person needing access. Where this is the case, a cloud model must be created. Firstly the model is created on the Architype server, using the correct template, units and coordinates as above. It should be named correctly in accordance with Section 4.1. Secondly, the job will be set up as a project on BIM360 (this will be done by one of Architype\u2019s BIM360 admins \u2013 contact them through the Architype #RevithowdoIdothat Slack Channel in plenty of time). The folders outlined in Section 3.1 will need to be created - this can be done manually in BIM360, or the folders can be copied from an empty folder structure template onto BIM360 through Desktop Connector (Section 3.2) to save time. Once all of this is in place, the model should be pushed to the cloud using the \u2018collaborate\u2019 tab as shown below. Project Information \u00b6 Starting View \u00b6 The template file contains a \u2018Starting View\u2019. This is the view which holds key project information and opens up first when you open Revit. Once in Revit, it can be found within Legends in the Project Browser. The following information must be filled in at the beginning of the project: \u2018PROJECT INFORMATION\u2019 - Number, Name, Client, User Client, Employer/Client (D&B) \u2018KEY PROJECT DATA\u2019 - Ground Floor FFL \u2018FILE INFORMATION\u2019 - \u2018File Created by\u2019 should be your company email address. - \u2018Revit version\u2019: To find out this, go to the small down arrow beside the help button at the top right of the screen \u2013 then to \u2018About Autodesk Revit\u2019 , this will open up a window containing the information relating to the version you are working in. Manage \u00b6 While filling in the required information on the Starting View, the Project Location and Project Information should also be filled in. These can both be found under the \u2018Manage\u2019 tab. Project Location: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Project Location\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Location\u2019 button. The address of the site should be enetered here. Project Information: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Settings\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Project Information\u2019 button. Enter all known project information here. Worksets \u00b6 A workset is a collection of elements in a model. They are useful to help organise elements so members of a team can choose to display and work on selected worksets. They can be found by clicking on this icon ( insert icon here ) at the bottom of the Revit window. Typically, a project is expected to include the following worksets which are set up within the Architype Revit Template Note There will also be the Revit default \u2018Workset1\u2019 and \u2018Shared Levels and Grids\u2019 workset. These shall be kept intact. Shared Levels and Grids shall contain all Levels and Grids elements to allow for easy maintenance across the board. In order to set up new Worksets either click on the worksets icon at the bottom of the screen, or access via the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Manage Collaboration\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Worksets\u2019. In the Worksets dialogue click \u2018New\u2019 and enter a name (worksets must be named in accordance with protocol outlined in Section 7.6). To display the workset in all project views as default select \u2018Visible in all views\u2019. Clear this option if you want the workset to display only in views where you specifically turn on its visibility. Copy/Monitor Strategy for Datum Elements \u00b6 When collaborating on a project with other teams, use the Copy/Monitor tool to monitor and coordinate changes to important elements of the design. Use the Copy/Monitor tool when the following statements are true: The architectural team, the structural team, and the engineering team use Revit software. Each team must be informed of changes to levels, grids, and other elements. The teams will link models to work on the same building design. Each team maintains its own edition of the model and uses Revit software to develop the design for their discipline. Each model is linked to the other models to share information about changes to monitored elements in the building design. This will allow the other teams to control the graphical representation of datum elements within their model while maintaining correct relationship. Also, any changes to Levels and Grids in the parent model which the levels were copied from will create a warning in the model which they were copied to. Creating a single point of truth, eliminating possible errors. Under the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab there is a \u2018Copy/Monitor\u2019 button, select this then \u2018Select Link\u2019 and click on the link you wish to copy/monitor levels from. A new options bar will appear, select \u2018Copy\u2019, tick \u2018Multiple\u2019 then click on to the levels. Note that you must select the small finish button after clicking on each level, when that\u2019s done select the large finish button to end the process. \" Insert image ref here \" Click here for more information from Autodesk Knowledge network. Adding Sheet Revisions \u00b6 All drawings which are issued from Revit will require a revision (the first time a drawing is issued it will go out as Rev 01). Nothing will ever be issued as Rev \u2013 or Rev 0. For more information refer to Section 4. To add a revision to the project, go to the \u2018View Tab\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018Sheet Composition\u2019 panel \u2013 then click \u2018Revisions\u2019. Add a revision and fill in all the required information: \" Insert image ref here \" Date: enter the date on which the drawing will be issued Description: enter the description of the revision. This will show in the revision schedule on the sheet. Issued to: this will read as \u2018Checked\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who checked the drawing should be entered here. Issued by: this will read as \u2018Drawn\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who did the drawing, or made the revision, should be entered here. To enter a revision onto a sheet, go to the properties of the sheet and select the \u2018Edit\u2019 button beside options. This will allow you to tick the revisions you want to add to the sheet. \" Insert image ref here \" This is how they will appear in the Titleblock: \" Insert image ref here \"","title":"Project Template"},{"location":"00-Superseded/setup/#project-template","text":"Where a new project is created in Revit the most up to date version of the \u2018Architype Template\u2019 shall be used.

Navisworks is project review software. It allows us to federate and analyse models to improve coordination and communication of designs.

So we Add Test and name it something appropriate such as MEP-Ducts vs Str-Floors. In selection A we change it from Standard to Sets. This now allows us to pick from the Search Sets that we have made. We do the same for Selection B. You then need to select the settings to ensure you get results you want. Starting with Type: There are four default clash test types for you to choose from: Hard Choose this option if you want the clash test to detect actual intersections between geometry. Hard (Conservative) This option performs the same clash test as Hard, however, it additionally applies a conservative intersection method. Clearance Choose this option if you want the clash test to check for geometry within a specific distance from other geometry (see tolerance for more information). You can use this type of clash when, for example, pipes need to have space for insulation around them. Note: Clearance clashes are not the same as \u201csoft\u201d clashes. Clearance clashes detect for static geometry coming within a distance of other geometry, whereas soft clashes detect potential clashes between moving components. Clash Detective supports soft clash checking when you link it to Object Animation. Duplicates Choose this option if you want the clash test to detect for duplicate geometry. You can use this type of clash test to check a model against itself to ensure the same part has not been drawn, or referenced twice, for example. Tolerance controls the severity of the clashes reported and the ability to filter out negligible clashes, which can be assumed to be worked around on site. Tolerance is used for hard clash, clearance clash and duplicate clash types of clash test. Any clash found that is within this tolerance will be reported, whereas clashes outside of this tolerance will be ignored. So for Hard clashes, a clash with a severity of between zero and the tolerance value will be ignored, whereas for Clearance clashes, a clash with a severity of more than the tolerance value will be ignored as it is further away than the distance required. Similarly, a Duplicate clash with a severity of more than the tolerance value will be ignored as it is likely to be a separate, yet identical piece of geometry. Useful Tip - When you set the Tolerance positives numbers means that the 2 objects clashing have to exceed each other\u2019s surface by that amount. So they physically have to clash. When you set the Tolerance to a negative number you are affectively putting a zone around the objects clashing which means that if they are within a certain distance of each other it will still raise it as a clash even though they aren\u2019t physically clashing. Link allows you to link your clash detection TimeLiner. A Navisworks tool we are not talking about in this document. So in most cases this will be left as None. Step is related to TimeLiner Composite Object Clashing it is important that we have this option ticked as what this does is remove multiple clashes within a composite object. If you had a concrete metal deck and a column passing through it, if this wasn\u2019t ticked then it would appear in the results twice. Once where it clashes with the metal deck and once where it clashes with the concrete. In the Rules tab there are 4 rules by default. You want these ticked except for Items in same file as by having this ticked it will ignore clashes that are in the same model which means you will have 0 clashes if you are checking MEP vs MEP etc. Useful Tip \u2013 change all these settings when you create the first clash test as it will remember them when you create your next one. There is no way of changing all the settings in one go once you have multiple clash tests and you will have to change all them individually. A clash test can have one of 4 statuses: New Indicates a clash test that has not yet been run with the current model. Done Indicates a clash test that has been successfully run with the latest version of the model. Old Indicates a clash test that has been altered in some way since being set up. This might include changing an option, or having loaded the latest revision of the model. Note: Individual clash statuses can still be edited in a clash test with a status of Old. Partial Indicates a clash test that has been interrupted during execution. Results are available up to the point of interruption. To run the clash tests that you have created simply select update all.","title":"Advanced Clash Test"},{"location":"navisworks/Creating%20Clash%20Tests/Basic%20Clash%20Test/basic-clash-test/","text":"To create a basic clash test we need to open the Clash Detective window which can be found in the Home Tab and under Tools.

It can be found in Revit by going to the Add-Ins tab. From External Tools you have the option for Navisworks SwitchBack 2016. By selecting it you are turning it on. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing you have turned it on but you can select it as many times as you like, it won\u2019t turn it off. Once you have turned it on you now go back to Navisworks. In Navisworks there is two ways of using SwitchBack. Firstly you can right click on the item and choose SwitchBack or if you are selecting the item through Clash Detective then there is a button to press that will do SwitchBack. When using the button from Clash Detective ensure you select the button on the correct size of the results in order for it to recognise the item. Both ways do the same thing where it creates a new 3D view called Navisworks SwitchBack and uses a camera view to show exactly the view you have in Navisworks. Please note that there is sometimes a graphical issue where the items you have selected for SwitchBack aren\u2019t showing. To resolve this stay in the Navisworks SwitchBack view in Revit and select a view from the view cube. Then go back into Navisworks and re do the SwitchBack. This time the view should be created with all the objects turned on.","title":"Navisworks SwitchBack"},{"location":"navisworks/Grouping%20the%20Clash%20Results/grouping-the-clash-results/","text":"Grouping the Clash Results \u00b6 Once we have carried out the clash detection and published the NWF to an NWD we need to start grouping the results. Before we group the result we should remove the clashes with 0 results. This should only be done if you are working in the NWD and not in the original NWF. To delete the 0 clashes from the NWD we need to first open Clash Detective from the Home tab. Now we need to run the Compact All tool. This removes all the resolved clashes. Next we need to sort by Clashes. We do this by clicking on the Clashes heading. Click on it twice so that we have the biggest number at the top. Scroll down the list until the clashes are at 0. Select the first 0 result and then scroll to the bottom of the list. Unfortunately you have to delete each test individually so the depending on how many 0 results there are you are better of using the Delete key on the keyboard. You can hold it down but not be aware that its slightly delayed in updating. When you get closer to the bottom you may want to press delete individually so that you don\u2019t delete results. Now you are eft with only tests that have clashes. We can group clashes based on levels or based on a components included in the clash. The reason that we do this is because potentially there will be 10,000+ clashes in any model. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there are 10,000+ issues. We need to review the results and understand them so that we can give better feedback to the rest of the team. This can be explained by imagining that we have 1 pipe running down a corridor and it clashes with 30 beams. If the method of resolving this is to move the pipe down or include voids in the beam then that is actually only 1 issue and sorting that will resolve 30 clashes. By grouping the clashes you go from 10,000+ to less than 100 pretty quickly. To start grouping the clashes we need to select the clash test that we want to review and then select the Results tab. You will now see all the results for that clash test. For example there might be 528 individual clashes. But this doesn\u2019t really represent the number of issues that there actually are. There are three main ways in which you can group clashes. You can group clashes involving item. You can group by items you select or you can use the Clash Grouper add-in.

This is a much quicker method than the Group Clashes Involving Item method as you can select everything at a specific level or everything of a specific type. For this example I will be using the selection tree to choose items but the method is the same if you are picking items from the model. The first thing we do in this method is change the filter type from None to Inclusive. What this option does is only shows you the clashes involving items you have picked either from the model directly or from the selection tree. The clash test we are using is still STR-StructuralColumns vs STR-StructuralFraming so from the Selection Tree we need to expand the Structures Model. We can now expand the level we want to group by and then expand Structural Framing. You then get the different families from Revit listed so you can expand this so that you can group the clashes by level and then by family type. Becaue we have the Inclusive filter on the number of clashes shown now only includes those involving the 400 x 800mm at the 02 \u2013 Floor level. In the clash results now we can select the first clash shown and then scroll to the bottom and shift+left click to select all the clashes. Right click and select Group. This group now contains all the clashes and it shows them all on the screen. This makes the information much easier to review. The group can then be renamed so that it\u2019s easy to review.

Depending on the number of different elements in the test this can be time consuming but is still quicker than the Group Clashes Involving Item method.

To do this you need to open the NWC file, turn the render style to wire frame, orbit around the model and then turn it back to shaded. The same method we do when we append models . Then we need to clear out any views that have been transferred across as these are not needed. To do this we need to open up the Saved Viewpoints window. This can be opened by going to the View tab and then under Workspace there is a Windows button that drops down. Tick Saved Viewpoints and the window will appear. Typically there will be a folder called 3D Views that has a couple of saved viewpoints in. Select the folder and delete it. Now you need to review the model. This can just be a visual inspection of the model to ensure that everything has transferred across. If it appears that something hasn\u2019t transferred across as you would expect you may want to check your export settings and the 3D view you were in in the native software and make sure that you can see everything before you export it. It is also important to ensure that the properties have transferred properly. As in some instances the Navisworks file will be the one that people use to review the information. This can be checked by selecting any object in Navisworks and reviewing the Properties. Properties can be access from the Home tab and then Display. In Properties under the Element tab you should see all the parameters that exist within the native software. Once you are happy that Navisworks is showing everything we can now publish this to NWD.

The process is different though if you have you have used the Navisworks Template . This is because we want to remove the clash tests before we share the information. This is done for 2 reasons. Firstly so that external teams can't extract our code that we have used to create it and secondly, so that the clashes can be reviewed in the Navisworks Freedom without the need for a licence. This process assumes you have run clash detection . To publish the NWD follow the same procedure as for NWC to NWD. Once you have made the NWD save the NWF and then open the NWD. Now you can group the results . Once the results are grouped we can prepare the model for issuing externally. Because the template data is stored in the model still the first thing we need to do is save the results in Navisworks but out of Clash Detective. To do this we need to go to the report tab in Clash Detection. For the contents we can tick everything and for the Include Clashes section we can tick just New and Active unless you have been reviewing and approving clashes. For the Output Settings we need to set the Report Type as All tests (combined) and Report Format as Viewpoints. Make sure Preserve result highlighting is ticked. And select Write Report. Now if you go to Saved Viewpoints, from the View Tab and selecting it from the Windows drop down list. All the clash results are now saved as viewpoints. Once this is done we can go back to Clash Detective and delete all the tests. This is done by selecting Delete All Once that is done we need to delete the Search Sets that the template created. This is done by going to Manage Sets from the Home tab and selecting the Sets drop down list. The folder should be called Clash Detection. Select this and delete.

Example ART-FUR-Office_Chair Family Type Naming \u00b6 If a Family has only one Type, it should be named Default The Type name should be brief but descriptive. It shouldn\u2019t include the Family name in the Type name - e.g. use 900 rather than Door 900 Where there is a dimension in the type name there should be no space between the number and the \u2018x\u2019 and the units should be shown. i.e. 1000x1200mm You could also add the dimensions as parameters and add these to the label and use schedules to confirm the name matches the dims. Examples: ART-DEI-Plywood (Family name) 9mm (Type Name) 12mm ART-DEI-Refuge_Symbol (Family name) Default (Type Name) Note When you are loading in families or other objects, ensure that you have renamed them to comply with the standards in this document. For example, when loading or using Enscape families. Levels Naming \u00b6 Levels should be named in accordance with: [Number]-[Volume-optional]-[Description] Number: 2 digit level number Volume: As described in 'File Naming' Description: a concise description of the level, with underscores between words. Example 01-A-First_Floor Rooms / Spaces / Units Naming \u00b6 The following full naming convention should be used: [Level]-[Number]-[Identifier\u2013optional]\u2013[Description] Level: As described in 'File Naming' Number: In principle, the main building entrance (or the primary space when entering the facility e.g. Entrance Lobby) will be numbered 001, the initial room number. From Location 001, the process is referred to as the \u2018left hand rule method\u2019 where you would run your hand along the left hand wall of Location 001 and as soon as you enter another location (through a door) then this would be Location 002. If the room you are in has a cupboard / store located within it then this should be regarded as another Location with the appropriate number allocated. Stairwells: Stairwells should be tagged with the same room number as they are on the ground floor, or whatever floor they begin on i.e. the same Location number is used for the whole stairwell (on all floors). Lifts / Lift Shafts: Each lift and the associated Lift Shaft should be allocated a room number on the lowest floor and the same number used throughout the document on subsequent levels. If there is more than one lift (and shaft) it would have its own number. Basements / Outbuildings: When all floors from the Ground up have been tagged then the final step would be to tag the basement followed by any outbuildings on site. Identifier: Insert Text Here Description: a common or given name which represents the intended use or function of the room, with underscores between words. Multiple rooms in the same building may have identical room names, e.g Classroom. It is not necessary to differentiate them, e.g. Classroom A, Classroom B, etc. Example A-01-001-LR-Living_Room Masses Naming \u00b6 Masses are created through the \u2018Massing & Site\u2019 tab within the \u2018Conceptual Mass\u2019 panel \u2013 \u2018In-place mass\u2019. They are usually used for conceptual design to show the gross volume, gross floor area, and gross surface area of a mass or to apply walls at strange angles using \u2018apply to face\u2019. They should be named following the families naming convention. [Originator]-[Category]-[Description] Originator: As described in 'File Naming' Category: MAS for Mass Description: A short but readable description with underscores between words. If the mass is level specific add the level or zone acronym after the description i.e. 01(Fist Floor) or SB (Sports block) Example ART-MAS-Existing_Building Note They should not be named Mass 1, Mass 2 etc. There should be no duplicates of masses, the description should differentiate between them. Click here for more information about Masses from Autodesk Knowledge Network. Worksets \u00b6 Worksets should be named in a consistent and logical manner, so as to identify the owner and purpose of the workset. Each model should have a relatively small number of worksets (likely between 5 and 10) all of which should be named following the convention below. For further information on setting up 'Worksets' [Originator]-[Description] Originator: As described in 'File Naming' Description: Description of workset content; used in isolation in smaller projects, or in combination with one or both of Zone and Level on larger projects. Use underscores between words in the description. Note The two exceptions to this rule are the default \u2018Workset1\u2019 and \u2018Shared Levels and Grids\u2019 worksets. These are default worksets, are found in all projects, and shall be kept intact.

If so, this will be advised by the BIM Co-Ordinator on the specific project as part of the Information Management/BIM requirements. In these cases we ask that the Project Architect informs one of Architype\u2019s Information Management team, to ensure that there are no wider implications.

This no longer requires users to locate the template on the server, instead, simply open Revit, go to \u2018File\u2019 \u2018New\u2019 \u2013 and select \u2018Architype Template\u2019. Architype\u2019s Revit Template is a read-only document and must not be edited by any member of staff. The template contains preloaded Detail Items, Filled Regions, View Templates, Worksets and Basic Wall/Floor/Roof Types. It also contains predefined Text Types, Line Styles and Browser Organisation. This is done to speed up the process of starting a new project and ensures that there are examples of correct naming within the project. The template will be regularly updated to ensure compliance with current BS EN ISO Standards. If a high standard view template, detail component etc, has been created which works well and may be of value to others, then contact one of Architype\u2019s Information Management team to have it inserted into the next revision of the template. Coordinate system \u00b6 All Revit models shall use a consistent and uniform coordinate system throughout the project\u2019s lifecycle to ensure information is always precisely aligned. Shared coordinates should only be acquired from a separate site model i.e. a geolocated site model should be created from a survey to share with all other disciplines. The main building is then modelled in a separate Revit file. This will make it easier for other consultants to acquire coordinates, it is also easier if the building needs to move. Attention It is important that this part of the project is carried out correctly as it can have a lasting effect on a project if done incorrectly. This should **only be done by a member of the BIM managment team.** Survey Point \u00b6 The survey point identifies a real-world location near the model, such as a corner of the project site or the intersection of 2 property lines. It defines the origin of the survey coordinate system, which provides a real-world context for the model. Project Base Point \u00b6 The project base point defines the origin (0,0,0) of the project coordinate system, used as a reference point for measurements across the site. Where there are gridlines in a project, the preference is to place the Project Base Point at the intersection of grid A-1. Internal Origin (or Start-up Location): \u00b6 The internal origin is the starting point for the internal coordinate system, which provides the basis for positioning all elements in the model. The location of the internal origin never moves. It\u2019s the origin from which the survey point (and real-world context) and project base point are established. The following table is included within Architype\u2019s standard BIM Execution Plan (BEP) \u2013 and, where we are employed as BIM Manager, this will need to be filled in by the project team at the start of the project. Project Units \u00b6 It is important to use consistent units and measurement across the project. Default project units shall be as set out in the table below: Type Symbol Units Accuracy (Decimal Places) Length mm Milimeters 0 Area m 2 Square Meters 0 Volume m 3 Cubic Meters 0 Weight Kg kilogram 0 Cost \u00a3 Pound Sterling 0 Spatial Coordinates m Meters (based on the UK Ordnance Survey National Grid Easting\u2019s and Northing\u2019s co-ordinate system) 3 Datum m Meters (based on the UK Ordnance Survey National Datum) 3 Attention Note: temporary dimensions (such as the below screenshot) will display with decimal places. Setting up the Project Browser \u00b6 Sheets \u00b6 Sheets should be organised in Revit through their numbering, sorting them into View Group & Sub View Group. For more information on numbering, see 'Number' in 'File Naming' \u2018View Group\u2019 : indicates the series number \u2018Sub View Group\u2019 : indicates the sub series number These can be found, and edited, in the properties bar of a selected sheet or view. In order to set up this organisation at the start of a project, follow the steps set out below: Views \u00b6 Revit views are categorised into: 01 Working (day-to-day working views) 02 Drawing Set (views which are on sheets) 03 Presentation (views to be taken into other pieces of software for presentation) 04 Coordination (views to assist with coordination, i.e. overlaying imported models) Tip Within '01 Working' category you can put your initials at the end of the view name to let other team members know you are working on this particular view. When you are done or no longer need the view it should be deleted. To ensure that the project browser stays as organised as possible, views from the \u201802 Drawing Set\u2019 should be placed on sheets as soon as possible. Once they are on sheets they will be automatically removed from the browser and accessed only through the sheets. This keeps the project browser tidy and makes sure that drawings are always developed in the context of a sheet. Although this process is incorporated into the Architype Template, for those working in projects already set up on previous templates, the process below can be followed. Creating a Cloud Model \u00b6 The majority of project Revit models will be stored on BIM360, certainly any project with more than one person needing access. Where this is the case, a cloud model must be created. Firstly the model is created on the Architype server, using the correct template, units and coordinates as above. It should be named correctly in accordance with 'File Naming' Secondly, the job will be set up as a project on BIM360 (this will be done by one of Architype\u2019s BIM360 admins \u2013 contact them through the Architype #revithowdoidothat Slack Channel in plenty of time). The folders outlined in 'Folder Structure' will need to be created - this can be done manually in BIM360, or the folders can be copied from an empty folder structure template onto BIM360 through As described in 'Desktop Connector' to save time. Once all of this is in place, the model should be pushed to the cloud using the \u2018collaborate\u2019 tab as shown below. Click here for more information on creating a cloud model from the Autodesk Knowledge Network. Project Information \u00b6 Starting View \u00b6 The template file contains a \u2018Starting View\u2019. This is the view which holds key project information and opens up first when you open Revit. Once in Revit, it can be found within Legends in the Project Browser. The following information must be filled in at the beginning of the project: \u2018PROJECT INFORMATION\u2019 - Number, Name, Client, User Client, Employer/Client (D&B) \u2018KEY PROJECT DATA\u2019 - Ground Floor FFL \u2018FILE INFORMATION\u2019 - \u2018File Created by\u2019 should be your company email address. - \u2018Revit version\u2019: To find out this, go to the small down arrow beside the help button at the top right of the screen \u2013 then to \u2018About Autodesk Revit\u2019 , this will open up a window containing the information relating to the version you are working in. Example Add typical example of te output for tis location here Manage \u00b6 While filling in the required information on the Starting View, the Project Location and Project Information should also be filled in. These can both be found under the \u2018Manage\u2019 tab. Project Location: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Project Location\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Location\u2019 button. The address of the site should be entered here. Project Information: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Settings\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Project Information\u2019 button. Enter all known project information here. Worksets \u00b6 A workset is a collection of elements in a model. They are useful to help organise elements so members of a team can choose to display and work on selected worksets. They can be found by clicking on this icon at the bottom of the Revit window. Typically, a project is expected to include the following worksets which are set up within the Architype Revit Template Tip There will also be the Revit default \u2018Workset1\u2019 and \u2018Shared Levels and Grids\u2019 workset. These shall be kept intact. Shared Levels and Grids shall contain all Levels and Grids elements to allow for easy maintenance across the board. In order to set up new Worksets either click on the worksets icon at the bottom of the screen, or access via the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Manage Collaboration\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Worksets\u2019. In the Worksets dialogue click \u2018New\u2019 and enter a name (worksets must be named in accordance with protocol outlined in 'Component Naming' . To display the workset in all project views as default select \u2018Visible in all views\u2019. Clear this option if you want the workset to display only in views where you specifically turn on its visibility. Copy/Monitor Strategy for Datum Elements \u00b6 When collaborating on a project with other teams, use the Copy/Monitor tool to monitor and coordinate changes to important elements of the design. Use the Copy/Monitor tool when the following statements are true: The architectural team, the structural team, and the engineering team use Revit software. Each team must be informed of changes to levels, grids, and other elements. The teams will link models to work on the same building design. Each team maintains its own edition of the model and uses Revit software to develop the design for their discipline. Each model is linked to the other models to share information about changes to monitored elements in the building design. This will allow the other teams to control the graphical representation of datum elements within their model while maintaining correct relationship. Also, any changes to Levels and Grids in the parent model which the levels were copied from will create a warning in the model which they were copied to. Creating a single point of truth, eliminating possible errors. Under the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab there is a \u2018Copy/Monitor\u2019 button, select this then \u2018Select Link\u2019 and click on the link you wish to copy/monitor levels from. A new options bar will appear, select \u2018Copy\u2019, tick \u2018Multiple\u2019 then click on to the levels. Note that you must select the small finish button after clicking on each level, when that\u2019s done select the large finish button to end the process. Click here for more information on creating a cloud model from the Autodesk Knowledge Network. Adding Sheet Revisions \u00b6 All drawings which are issued from Revit will require a revision (the first time a drawing is issued it will go out as Rev 01). Nothing will ever be issued as Rev \u2013 or Rev 0. For more information refer to Section 4. To add a revision to the project, go to the \u2018View Tab\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018Sheet Composition\u2019 panel \u2013 then click \u2018Revisions\u2019. Add a revision and fill in all the required information: Date: enter the date on which the drawing will be issued Description: enter the description of the revision. This will show in the revision schedule on the sheet. Issued to: this will read as \u2018Checked\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who checked the drawing should be entered here. Issued by: this will read as \u2018Drawn\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who did the drawing, or made the revision, should be entered here. To enter a revision onto a sheet, go to the properties of the sheet and select the \u2018Edit\u2019 button beside options. This will allow you to tick the revisions you want to add to the sheet. This is how they will appear in the Titleblock:","title":"Project Setup"},{"location":"revit-standards/project-setup/#project-setup","text":"","title":"Project Setup"},{"location":"revit-standards/project-setup/#project-template","text":"Where a new project is created in Revit the most up to date version of the \u2018Architype Template\u2019 shall be used.

Note: LOCATION always at the front of the DESCRIPTION, i.e. \"LAB PARTITION\" Specifying part of DETAIL being drawn is always at end, i.e. \"SLIDING DOOR HEAD\" Typical is always at the front and written as \"TYPICAL\" MATERIAL always at end and written as \" - CONCRETE\" \"And\" or \"&\" always written as \"+\" When describing LOCATION use no space between multiples, i.e. \"LAB+LOBBY\" No abbreviations when it can be avoided, i.e. \"CURTAIN WALL\" and not \"CW\" Example: 00-100-Classroom_Layout In the WORKING views you can put you initials at the end of a drawing to let other team members know you are working on this particular view. When you are done or no longer need the view it should be removed. Refer to Section 2.4. \u2003 View Template Naming \u00b6 All views that appear on sheets should have a View Template applied. The view template should be named in accordance with: [Type]-[Scale]-[Description if applicable] Type: Choose a type from the list below. PLN Plan RCP Reflected Ceiling Plan SCT Section DTL Detail Views ELE Elevation SHE Schedules 3DI Internal 3D Views, Walkthroughs 3DE External 3D Views, Walkthroughs Scale: As applicable in format of 200, 100, 50 etc. *If the scale is not included in the template then replace with \u2018custom\u2019. All scales between 2-15 should be DTL. Description: Short description, for example \u2018General_Arrangement\u2019 \u2018Fire\u2019 or \u2018Planning\u2019, with each word separated by underscores. Always keep the description to the end so that types and scales are kept together in the list of options available. There should be no number after the name to suggest a duplicate like \u2018Planning 2\u2019. Try to limit the number of templates in a project, always check if there is a template which is already available that you can make work with your drawing before creating a new one. When naming, remember that \u2018elevation\u2019 or \u2018section\u2019 does not need to be included in the description as it is shown in the type. For example, ART-ELE-50_InternalElevations. \u2018Internal\u2019 alone is a sufficient description. Example: PLN-100-Planning Scale can be omitted when naming templates for schedules. Example: SHE-Window_Assembly. \u2003 Filter Naming \u00b6 Filters can be applied to views to alter the visibility or graphic display of elements. There can be multiple filters applied to views and including filters in view templates can apply filters to multiple views. There are two types of filters, rule-based filters and selection-based filters. Rule based filters identify elements using parameter values for selected categories. Selection-based filters identify elements that you select to isolate, hide, or apply graphic settings to the elements in the selection. When naming filters follow the below rule: [Category]-[Rule]_[Description] Category: The category that was ticked from the available list to make the filter. i.e. Walls Note Rule: A brief explanation of the rule used i.e.NameContains Description: A description of the filter rules i.e. FireProof Each section should use CamelCase where there is more than one word Example: Walls-NameContains_FireProof (All walls containing \u2018Fireproof\u2019 in the name will show in red) Walls-NameNotContain_FireProof (All walls that do not have \u2018Fireproof\u2019 in the name will show as Grey) Schedule Naming \u00b6 Schedules must be named in a presentable format as this is the title that appears on sheets. [Type]-[Level-if applicable]-[Area-if applicable]-[Working-optional] Type: What is the schedule for? Door Schedule, Floor Areas, PH Room Volumes, Sheet List etc. Level: If the schedule relates to a specific level use Ground Level, First Floor etc. If the schedule applies to the whole building, then leave this part out. Area: If the schedule relates to specific area of the building, then use the name of the area i.e. Sports Block or Nursery. If the schedule applies to the whole building, then leave this part out. Working: If a schedule is created for the purpose of editing instances and won\u2019t be shown on a sheet add \u2018Working\u2019 to the name. Examples: The following schedules are included in the Revit Template: Sheet List View List Room Schedule Legend Naming \u00b6 Legends must be named in a presentable format as this is what appears in the project browser. The title is for internal use only, so that others can locate the relevant legend when needed, the one shown on the sheet is usually written in the legend itself. Never copy/duplicate a legend and leave the name reading as \u2018copy 1\u2019. Always rename with a suitable title in accordance with: [Type]-[Description]-[Area-if applicable]_[Working-optional] Type: The type should always be first in the tile to ensure that the list is grouped by these. Choose the appropriate \u2018type\u2019 from the list below. Key A named list of symbols Legend A Key & Notes Note Notes to accompany a drawing or key Description: A concise description of what the Legend contains or where it should be used. i.e. \u2018Access_Maintenance\u2019, \u2018Window_Types\u2019, \u2018Site_Plan\u2019. Words should be separated by underscores. Area: If applicable an area can be added to the name to reference a specific part of the building. i.e. \u2018Sports Block\u2019, \u2018Nursery\u2019. The area can also be used to reference the type of drawing which the legend is for. i.e. \u2018Section\u2019. Words should be separated by underscores. Working: This section is optional. If a Legend is created but won\u2019t be shown on a sheet add Working to the name.
