##  Purpose

Standardisation plays an important role in the exchange of information. It helps maintain consistency both in house and with other design team members. It should be remembered at all times that models and their related information are regularly passed on to other team members in digital format.

Changes to current office standards should apply to new projects only, and is at the discretion of the BIM Information Managment team.

Where project specific BIM procedures are required then they should be read in conjunction with this manual but project specific standards will take precedence over this manual.
