# File Naming

## File Naming Convention

The naming convention creates a unique title for each document or drawing produced as part of the project – it should be used for everything issued (drawings, sketches, models, documents, meeting minutes, technical notes, trackers, matrices… everything!) 

This convention has been developed to align with the BS EN ISO 19650-2:2018 standard and must be strictly adhered to. (At the start of the project the convention should be agreed with the whole project team, and any changes which are necessary must be discussed with Architype’s Information Team for approval). 

The naming convention consists of the following fields (to be read in conjunction with the detailed breakdown at the end of Section 4.1):

*Metadata fields are used in the Common Data Environment (CertCentral®) and will be automatically stripped from the file name after upload. If your project is using a different Common Data Environment (such as 4Projects, ASite or Box) there may be other rules regarding these fields. 

Model names will not show metadata unless being detached and issued to the CDE.

## Number
As stated above, the ‘Number’ part of the file name is a unique, 5 digit, identifier. 

Project 	Originator	Volume	Level	Document Type	Role	Number	Title	Status	Revision

The whole, 5-digit, number breaks down as follows:


**Category:** the first two digits of the five-digit number represent the main category number.
**Sub-category:** the remaining three digits represent the sub-category number. (Note, the last two numbers of the sub-category are to be sequential. i.e.11101,11102, 11103)

## Title

As stated above, in Section 4.1, the ‘Title’ part of the file name is textual description to be in Pascal Case format.

Project Originator	Volume	Level	Document Type	Role	Number	Title	Status	Revision

When the sheet has been printed to PDF to be uploaded to the CDE (Common Data Environment) for issue the tile must have NO spaces and should instead be separated by underscores.

**Example:** TEST-ART-XX-00-DR-A-11100-Ground_Floor_Plan-S3-P01

## Suitability Status 

Project Originator	Volume	Level	Document Type	Role	Number	Title	Status	Revision

The status makes it clear what the information should be used for, and by extension, what it should not be used for. These are defined by ISO19650 and must not be deviated from. 

Refer to Section 4.1 for a list of Suitability Status Codes.

**Example:** TEST-ART-XX-00-DR-A-11100-Ground_Floor_Plan-S3-P01 

(The status code S3 informs recipients that it is only suitable for review and comment.)

## Revision 

Project Originator	Volume	Level	Document Type	Role	Number	Title	Status	Revision

As information is developed it is important to keep track of the changes between previous and current revisions and versions. It is equally important to also keep track of which revision and version is shared with whom. 

NOTE: 
Nothing should ever be issued as Revision 0. The first time a piece of information is issued it should be given Revision 01.

Revisions are part of the shared parameters in a title block and are used in the file name of the sheet. Be aware, this process is established to allow correct integration with a Common Data Environment (CDE) under a compliant BIM workflow.

For further information on how to add revisions in Revit, refer to Section 2.9.
