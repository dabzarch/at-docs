# Welcome to the Architype Revit Standards

---

## Introduction

This Revit Standards document is both a “how to” and a reference guide for all of us who will be working on projects in Revit.

It aims to instil graphical, documentation and procedural standards to ensure we maintain a high degree of consistency across all of our projects, while ensuring that as a practice, we comply with the mandatory industry standards. It’s one of the first steps towards developing Architype to be an industry leading provider of Information Management and BIM Coordination delivery, which will supplement our PERFORM+ Consultancy.

As a priority it should save us all time in the ‘nuts and bolts’ of Revit working, and allow us to spend more time on what we do best – the design!

It is really important that everyone at Architype uses these standards, and does not deviate from them without discussion. 

However, we are always open to ideas – any suggestions please do let us know, so they can be incorporated into future revisions. The document will be regularly updated to ensure compliance with current BS EN ISO Standards. The latest guidance can always be found on this online hub or on the Architype Server in '.pdf' format in CAD Setup-Revit-Standards.

In some instances, a project specific standard may need to take precedence over this Revit standard. If so, this will be advised by the BIM Co-Ordinator on the specific project as part of the Information Management/ BIM requirements. In these cases we ask that the Project Architect informs one of Architype’s Information Management team, to ensure that there are no wider implications. 

We hope that this will be a welcome addition,
