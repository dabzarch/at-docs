# Folder Structure

---

## Information Received 

> Project – E Sharing & Coordination – E20 Received 

When information is received from the wider project team, it should be filed in this location on the Architype server, as an archive. Before this information is edited, or imported into Revit, it should be copied into a different location (see below). This means this folder stays as an accurate record.  

---

## Information Issued 
> Project – E Sharing & Coordination – E00 Issued – RIBA Stage

All information issued by the Architype team should be saved here, on the Architype server, in folders by dates, using the format YYMMDD. e.g. 201011

---

## Live Information
All *‘live’* information (including Revit models, linked data, families and shared parameters) should be saved either on the Architype server, or on BIM360. 

#### Server:
If you’re not using BIM360, information should be saved in the Revit folder for the appropriate project Stage. 
> Project – C Architectural Design – C00 Stages – RIBA Stage – 1 Revit

This ‘1 Revit’ folder is split down into sub-folders, as described below. 

#### Autodesk BIM360: 
If a project is saved on BIM360, the project’s BIM360 folder effectively becomes the ‘1 Revit’ folder above, and should be set up with the sub-folders described below.

!!! Note
    **Please ensure that all incoming files comply with the naming convention outlined in Section 4.1, Unless otherwise stated in your projects BIM Execution Plan (BEP).**

This ‘Revit’ folder is broken down into sub-folders as follows:

>- 1 CENTRAL FILE (Current Revit Central file – this would be the main architectural model, as well as site model)
>- 2 LINKED CAD 
>    - 2.1 INTERNAL - Linked, internally created, CAD information ONLY
>    - 2.2 EXTERNAL - CAD info received from others, organised in folders by Consultant
>        - Consultant Name - Discipline (Main folder)
>        - YYMMDD – Title (Sub-Folder)
>- 3 LINKED MODELS
>    - 3.1 INTERNAL - Linked, internally created, model information ONLY
>    - 3.2 EXTERNAL - Models received from others, organised in folders by Consultant
>        - Consultant Name - Discipline (Main folder)
>        - YYMMDD – Title (Sub-Folder)
>- 	3.3 COORDINATION - Incoming IFC, NWC etc. for coordination or review.
>    - 01 NAVISWORKS NWC – Where all files should be kept for the NWF file. Archived and replaced when there is a new file issued >(YYMMDD – Archived)
>    - 02 IFC FILES > YYMMDD - Title (Sub-Folder)
>    - 03 BCF FILES
>- 4 RESOURCES (Project Specific content)
>    - 4.1 FAMILIES - Revit family library specific to project
>    - 4.2 DATA - Keynotes, shared parameters, material library, scripts
>- 5 ARCHIVED - Files that are archived after issue, useful for archiving models after key project milestones. Files should be saved in folders by date.

# Desktop Connector
Desktop connector allows the user to link DWG files which are stored on BIM360 through windows explorer. It also allows you to view and open files, upload and download documents, edit and delete files, create and set up folder structures. Further information can be found here.

To link other Revit models or a DWG into a project from BIM360 follow the below steps.

1. Insert > link CAD / Revit
2. Navigate to the BIM630 Icon > Find the relevant project
3. Find the relevant file > Select it

!!! Note 
    **ALL links should be named in accordance with the file naming convention outlined in File Naming Convention or the associated project BEP**
