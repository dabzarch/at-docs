# Exporting From Revit #

To export from Revit you need to ensure that the settings for Revit are correct. You also want to make sure that the 3D view you are in is also set up properly. When you are issuing your own model for use in Navisworks ensure that the 3D view only has your model turned on and anything you don’t want exported is hidden or turned off in Visibility/Graphics. This ensures that only what you see is actually exported. Once your 3D view is set up correctly click on the big R, click on Export and click on NWC.
