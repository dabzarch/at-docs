# Appending Models

Appending models is the term Navisworks uses for linking models. When you open Navisworks you are in a blank file. From here you can either open files directly or append multiple files into one file. Navisworks is capable of opening almost any file type from AEC Model Authoring software. 

To append files go to the Home tab and click on Append

A dialog box opens where it allows you to select the files you want to load in. If the files are all in one folder then you can select multiple and load them all in once. It is important to note that the order in which the files are loaded in sets up how the selection tree is ordered which is important if we are using Navisworks for [Comparing Models](/navisworks/Comparing Models/comparing-models/). 

Once the files have been appended a useful tip is to change the Render Style to Wireframe, pan/orbit around the model and then change the Render Style back to Shaded or Full Render this ensures that the whole model has been downloaded and visible as Navisworks only displays information it can see. 

To access the Render Style click on the Viewpoint tab and go to Render Style and change the Mode.
