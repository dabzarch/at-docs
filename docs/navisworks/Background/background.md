# Background

What is Navisworks? Navisworks is project review software. It allows us to federate and analyse models to improve coordination and communication of designs. Navisworks isn’t just for coordination and clash detection but it can also be used for time sequencing and cost analysis. It can also link databases to form the beginnings of asset management. Navisworks is not model authoring software so you cannot modify the original files.

There are 3 different versions of Autodesk Navisworks:

* Freedom 
    - This is a free version of the software that can only open NWD or DWF file types. It is only a viewer so it is very limited in what it can actually do. But if you are only using Navisworks to view files then it is recommended that you open it in Freedom as there is no cost to use this version
* Simulate 
    - This version open all of the file types that Navisworks can read (see Supported File Types for details) and can do everything that Manage can do except for Clash Detection. 
* Manage 
    - This is the full version of the software and includes the ability to do Clash Detection



There are 3 different native file types for Autodesk Navisworks:

* NWC 
    - This is a Navisworks Cache file. If you export to Navisworks from other software or open a non Navisworks file type directly in Navisworks this is the file type that it will create. It is only meant to be used as a temporary file. NWC shouldn’t be shared with external design team members because it is an unverified version of the model
* NWD 
    - This is a Navisworks Document file. This is a published version of the NWC or NWF which means that it has been verified by the user creating it. This is the file type that we should share if requested to (please consult Architype BIM Team or your project BIM Lead if other native Navisworks files are requested)
* NWF 
    - This is a Navisworks Federated file. This is a file that houses live versions of other NWD or non-native Navisworks file types. This is the file that should be used when carrying out Clash Detection. 


We can use Navisworks to carry out a series of different tasks including but not limited to Visual Coordination, Clash Detection, Time Lining, Cost and Quantity take-offs and Rendering. But this document is going to focus on Visual Coordination and Clash Detection.
