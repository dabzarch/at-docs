# Visual Coordination

Visual coordination is a key part of any BIM Coordination because as good as Navisworks is at locating physical clashes between items it cannot locate issues when items do not physically clash but they are either not intended to be there generally or they are clearly in the wrong place. So it is important to do walkthroughs to try and spot these manually.

Before starting the walkthrough you need to set up the view so you are located in the area you want to start the visual coordination at. Once you are either in the model or located where you want to start you need to set up the walkthrough. From the Viewpoint tab, at Navigate, select Realism and then tick Third person

</a>

Then you want to select Walk and then in Realism tick Collison, Gravity and Crouch. Using the click wheel move the avatar until it is stood on the floor. With the left mouse click held down move the mouse in the direction that you want to move in and the avatar should move. You want to keep moving until you find issues that need reporting on. 

Because you have Gravity ticked the avatar will be able to automatically walk up and down stairs/ramps etc. because Collision is ticked it means that you cannot walk through objects that are in your way, including doors. So a Useful Tip is to right click on the object and select Hide. This should then allow you to continue walking around the model. 

Once you have found an issue in the walkthrough that you want to raise you can do this by going to the Review tab. From Redline you can then add Text. Draw allows you to add clouds and arrows etc.

As soon as you start adding Redline items to your view it automatically create a saved viewpoint. These viewpoints can be accessed by going to the View tab and clicking on Windows and ticking Saved Viewpoints.

</a>

It is important that you name these viewpoints appropriately so that it makes sense to other who comes to review this information. Itâ€™s also useful to add a folder to store these visual checks in. this can be done by right clicking in Saved Viewpoints and selecting New Folder.

When this file is saved, these comments will remain in the model until they are deleted. This means that when you receive new versions of the model and update the NWF you can click on the viewpoints and it will take you to same spot so you can see whether or not the issue has been resolved yet.
