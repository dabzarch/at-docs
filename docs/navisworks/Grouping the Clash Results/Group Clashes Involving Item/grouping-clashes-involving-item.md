To group clashes involving item we first have to decide which item we to group by in this example the STR-StructuralFraming is the problem so I am going to group by that.  Above the Structural Framing items there is a button with 3 boxes in another box. This is the group button but used in this case it groups by the items.

<a href="../../.././img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-1.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-1.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>

When you click on this I takes the individual clash and finds everything else that clashes with that item.

<a href="../../.././img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-2.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-2.png){: style="height:400px" :target="_blank"}
</a>
<a href="../../.././img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-3.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-3.png){: style="height:400px" :target="_blank" .right}
</a>

And in the clash results a group now exists with all the clashes included in that group.

<a href="../../.././img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-4.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/grouping-the-clashes-involving-item-4.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>

The group can then be renamed so that itâ€™s easy to review. If you were to do this for all the clashes in this test you would end up with 319 issues. Removing 209 individual clashes. Depending on the number of clashes in the test this can be time consuming.
