# Navisworks Template

In order to make running clash detection in Navisworks as easy possible we have developed predefined selection sets and clash tests as per the Navisworks Master spreadsheet that will take away a lot of the slow processes that we currently have to go through to create our clash detections properly. The templates have been designed to be as easy as possible to use. These templates are live and will be updated from time to time so do ensure you always access it from the BIM Management Network.

The template by default looks as follows
20200102-ART Digital Guerrilla - Navisworks Master – Spreadsheet defining criteria
Digital Guerrilla - Navisworks_ClashTests_P01 – refer to Navisworks Master for defining criteria
Digital Guerrilla - Navisworks_SelectionSets_P01 - refer to Navisworks Master for defining criteria

To load the Digital Guerrilla - Navisworks_SelectionSets_P01 template go to:
Home > Select & Search/ Sets > Manage Sets… > Import Search Sets… >

<a href="../.././img/navisworks-template-1.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/navisworks-template-1.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>
<a href="../.././img/navisworks-template-2.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/navisworks-template-2.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>

This will load Search Sets ONLY – alternatively you can load the Clash Tests which will also load the Search Sets.


To load the Digital Guerrilla - Navisworks_ClashTests _P01 template go to:
Home > Clash Detective > Import Clash Test >

<a href="../.././img/navisworks-template-3.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/navisworks-template-3.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>

What you will now see is all the clash tests have been created and if you go to Manage Sets you will see that a series of search sets have been created.

    ![Template](/navisworks/img/navisworks-template-4.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>
<a href="../.././img/navisworks-template-5.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/navisworks-template-5.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>

!!! Info 
    **Pro Tip**<br>
    To test that everything has worked correctly, select a few of the search sets for all the disciplines to ensure it’s actually selecting items in the model. 

You can now run clash detection by selecting update all.
