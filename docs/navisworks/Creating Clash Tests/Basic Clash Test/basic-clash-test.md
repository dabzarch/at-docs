To create a basic clash test we need to open the Clash Detective window which can be found in the Home Tab and under Tools.

    ![Template](/navisworks/img/basic-clash-test-1.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>

The Clash Detective window appears and looks like this:

<a href="../../.././img/basic-clash-test-2.png" target="_blank">
    ![Template](/navisworks/img/basic-clash-test-2.png){: style="height:auto" :target="_blank"}
</a>

As it says there are currently no clash tests defined. To create a test we select Add Test. It default to Test 1 but this should be renamed to something appropriate such as MEP vs Str. We then need to pick the items that will be clashed. In this case it Selection A will be the Building Services Model and Selection B will be the Structures Model.
