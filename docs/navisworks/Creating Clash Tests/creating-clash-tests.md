# Creating Clash Tests

Clash tests can only be created, edited or even just viewed in Navisworks Manage as Clash Detection is seen by Navisworks as their key feature and only make assessable in their most expensive version of the software. There are ways to run clash detection and view results within Simulate or even Freedom (see [Reporting the Clash Results](../../Visual Coordination/visual-coordination/) and [Issuing the Model for details](../../Publishing the Model/NWC to NWD/nwc-to-nwd/)).

Clash detection can be split into two types, Basic and Advanced. Basic is when you clash Model A against Model B and you leave the settings as they are. Advanced is when you clash specific discipline categories against specific discipline categories. If this is done properly you will end up with the same results but with the advanced clash detection the results are easier to review/understand and because the numbers are smaller they appear far easier to resolve. 

Depending on why you are doing clash detection changes the type of tests you run. If you are just doing it for single discipline use for internal purposes only then you only need to clash the elements related to that discipline. If itâ€™s multi-discipline then ensuring that those models are clashed against the other models as well as themselves is important. And if it is an external role then you need to make sure every model is clashed against every model and themselves.
