## Title Block
Architype Sheet Titleblocks are found within the Revit Template. 

The Revit template has been set up with prefixes as Shared Parameters. The titleblocks incorporate the following data:

**Project Name and Client:** this will be read directly from the Project Information within the manage tab when it has been filled in. See Section 2.6

**Drawing Title:** this will be read from the Sheet Title (which can be edited on the Titleblock itself, or in a sheet schedule or in the properties bar). 

**Project:** this will be read directly from the Project Information within the manage tab when it has been filled in. See Section 2.6

**Originator, Volume, Level, Type, Role:** must be filled out on the Titleblock (or in a sheet schedule or in the properties bar) in accordance with Section 4.1.

**Number:** this will be read from the Number (which can be edited on the Titleblock itself, or in a sheet schedule or in the properties bar) in accordance with Section 4.2.

**(Suitability) Status:** must be filled out on the Titleblock (or in a sheet schedule or in the properties bar). Refer to Section 4.4.

**Description:** This is the status description, and must be filled out on the Titleblock (or in a sheet schedule or in the properties bar). Refer to Section 4.4.

**Rev:** Revisions, this will go up in number as revisions are added to the sheet through the properties. Revisions can be created in the ‘View’ tab under ‘Revisions’. Refer to Section 2.9 for an explanation of how to create a new revision, and add a revision to a sheet. 

**Date:** This is the date on which the drawing is first issued (Rev 01). It should not be changed after the first issue. 

**Scale:** This is read from the Sheet properties itself. Note, this does not automatically update. If there are multiple views it should read ‘As indicated’ meaning that each view title will show the scale of the corresponding view.

**Drawn and Checked:** This is read automatically from the revision. Refer to Section 2.9.
