This no longer requires users to locate the template on the server, instead, simply open Revit, go to \u2018File\u2019 \u2018New\u2019 \u2013 and select \u2018Architype Template\u2019. Architype\u2019s Revit Template is a read-only document and must not be edited by any member of staff. The template contains preloaded Detail Items, Filled Regions, View Templates, Worksets and Basic Wall/Floor/Roof Types. It also contains predefined Text Types, Line Styles and Browser Organisation. This is done to speed up the process of starting a new project and ensures that there are examples of correct naming within the project. The template will be regularly updated to ensure compliance with current BS EN ISO Standards. If a high standard view template, detail component etc, has been created which works well and may be of value to others, then contact one of Architype\u2019s Information Management team to have it inserted into the next revision of the template. Coordinate system \u00b6 All Revit models shall use a consistent and uniform coordinate system throughout the project\u2019s lifecycle to ensure information is always precisely aligned. Shared coordinates should only be acquired from a separate site model i.e. you should create a geolocated site model from a survey to share with all other disciplines. The main building is then modelled in a separate Revit file. This will make it easier for other consultants to acquire coordinates, it is also easier if the building needs to move. Survey Point \u00b6 The survey point identifies a real-world location near the model, such as a corner of the project site or the intersection of 2 property lines. It defines the origin of the survey coordinate system, which provides a real-world context for the model. Project Base Point \u00b6 The project base point defines the origin (0,0,0) of the project coordinate system, used as a reference point for measurements across the site. Where there are gridlines in a project, the preference is to place the Project Base Point at the intersection of grid A-1. Internal Origin (or Start-up Location): \u00b6 The internal origin is the starting point for the internal coordinate system, which provides the basis for positioning all elements in the model. The location of the internal origin never moves. It\u2019s the origin from which the survey point (and real-world context) and project base point are established. The following table is included within Architype\u2019s standard BIM Execution Plan (BEP) \u2013 and, where we are employed as BIM Manager, this will need to be filled in by the project team at the start of the project. Project Units \u00b6 It is important to use consistent units and measurement across the project. Default project units shall be as below. Note: temporary dimensions (such as the below screenshot) will display with decimal places. Setting up the Project Browser \u00b6 Sheets \u00b6 Sheets should be organised in Revit through their numbering, sorting them into View Group & Sub View Group. For more information on numbering, see Section 4.2. \u2018View Group\u2019 : indicates the series number \u2018Sub View Group\u2019 : indicates the sub series number These can be found, and edited, in the properties bar of a selected sheet or view. In order to set up this organisation at the start of a project, follow these steps: Views \u00b6 Revit views are categorised into: 01 Working (day-to-day working views) 02 Drawing Set (views which are on sheets) 03 Presentation (views to be taken into other pieces of software for presentation) 04 Coordination (views to assist with coordination, i.e. overlaying imported models) Note: Within 01 Working category you can put your initials at the end of the view name to let other team members know you are working on this particular view. When you are done or no longer need the view it should be deleted. To ensure that the project browser stays as organised as possible, views from the \u201802 Drawing Set\u2019 should be placed on sheets as soon as possible. Once they are on sheets they will be automatically removed from the browser and accessed only through the sheets. This keeps the project browser tidy and makes sure that drawings are always developed in the context of a sheet. Although this process is incorporated into the Architype Template, for those working in projects already set up on previous templates, the process below can be followed. Creating a Cloud Model \u00b6 The majority of project Revit models will be stored on BIM360, certainly any project with more than one person needing access. Where this is the case, a cloud model must be created. Firstly the model is created on the Architype server, using the correct template, units and coordinates as above. It should be named correctly in accordance with Section 4.1. Secondly, the job will be set up as a project on BIM360 (this will be done by one of Architype\u2019s BIM360 admins \u2013 contact them through the Architype #RevithowdoIdothat Slack Channel in plenty of time). The folders outlined in Section 3.1 will need to be created - this can be done manually in BIM360, or the folders can be copied from an empty folder structure template onto BIM360 through Desktop Connector (Section 3.2) to save time. Once all of this is in place, the model should be pushed to the cloud using the \u2018collaborate\u2019 tab as shown below. Project Information \u00b6 Starting View \u00b6 The template file contains a \u2018Starting View\u2019. This is the view which holds key project information and opens up first when you open Revit. Once in Revit, it can be found within Legends in the Project Browser. The following information must be filled in at the beginning of the project: \u2018PROJECT INFORMATION\u2019 - Number, Name, Client, User Client, Employer/Client (D&B) \u2018KEY PROJECT DATA\u2019 - Ground Floor FFL \u2018FILE INFORMATION\u2019 - \u2018File Created by\u2019 should be your company email address. - \u2018Revit version\u2019: To find out this, go to the small down arrow beside the help button at the top right of the screen \u2013 then to \u2018About Autodesk Revit\u2019 , this will open up a window containing the information relating to the version you are working in. Manage \u00b6 While filling in the required information on the Starting View, the Project Location and Project Information should also be filled in. These can both be found under the \u2018Manage\u2019 tab. Project Location: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Project Location\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Location\u2019 button. The address of the site should be enetered here. Project Information: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Settings\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Project Information\u2019 button. Enter all known project information here. Worksets \u00b6 A workset is a collection of elements in a model. They are useful to help organise elements so members of a team can choose to display and work on selected worksets. They can be found by clicking on this icon ( insert icon here ) at the bottom of the Revit window. Typically, a project is expected to include the following worksets which are set up within the Architype Revit Template Note There will also be the Revit default \u2018Workset1\u2019 and \u2018Shared Levels and Grids\u2019 workset. These shall be kept intact. Shared Levels and Grids shall contain all Levels and Grids elements to allow for easy maintenance across the board. In order to set up new Worksets either click on the worksets icon at the bottom of the screen, or access via the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Manage Collaboration\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Worksets\u2019. In the Worksets dialogue click \u2018New\u2019 and enter a name (worksets must be named in accordance with protocol outlined in Section 7.6). To display the workset in all project views as default select \u2018Visible in all views\u2019. Clear this option if you want the workset to display only in views where you specifically turn on its visibility. Copy/Monitor Strategy for Datum Elements \u00b6 When collaborating on a project with other teams, use the Copy/Monitor tool to monitor and coordinate changes to important elements of the design. Use the Copy/Monitor tool when the following statements are true: The architectural team, the structural team, and the engineering team use Revit software. Each team must be informed of changes to levels, grids, and other elements. The teams will link models to work on the same building design. Each team maintains its own edition of the model and uses Revit software to develop the design for their discipline. Each model is linked to the other models to share information about changes to monitored elements in the building design. This will allow the other teams to control the graphical representation of datum elements within their model while maintaining correct relationship. Also, any changes to Levels and Grids in the parent model which the levels were copied from will create a warning in the model which they were copied to. Creating a single point of truth, eliminating possible errors. Under the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab there is a \u2018Copy/Monitor\u2019 button, select this then \u2018Select Link\u2019 and click on the link you wish to copy/monitor levels from. A new options bar will appear, select \u2018Copy\u2019, tick \u2018Multiple\u2019 then click on to the levels. Note that you must select the small finish button after clicking on each level, when that\u2019s done select the large finish button to end the process. \" Insert image ref here \" Click here for more information from Autodesk Knowledge network. Adding Sheet Revisions \u00b6 All drawings which are issued from Revit will require a revision (the first time a drawing is issued it will go out as Rev 01). Nothing will ever be issued as Rev \u2013 or Rev 0. For more information refer to Section 4. To add a revision to the project, go to the \u2018View Tab\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018Sheet Composition\u2019 panel \u2013 then click \u2018Revisions\u2019. Add a revision and fill in all the required information: \" Insert image ref here \" Date: enter the date on which the drawing will be issued Description: enter the description of the revision. This will show in the revision schedule on the sheet. Issued to: this will read as \u2018Checked\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who checked the drawing should be entered here. Issued by: this will read as \u2018Drawn\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who did the drawing, or made the revision, should be entered here. To enter a revision onto a sheet, go to the properties of the sheet and select the \u2018Edit\u2019 button beside options. This will allow you to tick the revisions you want to add to the sheet. \" Insert image ref here \" This is how they will appear in the Titleblock: \" Insert image ref here \"","title":"Project Template"},{"location":"00-Superseded/setup/#project-template","text":"Where a new project is created in Revit the most up to date version of the \u2018Architype Template\u2019 shall be used.

Example ART-FUR-Office_Chair Family Type Naming \u00b6 If a Family has only one Type, it should be named Default The Type name should be brief but descriptive. It shouldn\u2019t include the Family name in the Type name - e.g. use 900 rather than Door 900 Where there is a dimension in the type name there should be no space between the number and the \u2018x\u2019 and the units should be shown. i.e. 1000x1200mm You could also add the dimensions as parameters and add these to the label and use schedules to confirm the name matches the dims. Examples: ART-DEI-Plywood (Family name) 9mm (Type Name) 12mm ART-DEI-Refuge_Symbol (Family name) Default (Type Name) Note When you are loading in families or other objects, ensure that you have renamed them to comply with the standards in this document. For example, when loading or using Enscape families. Levels Naming \u00b6 Levels should be named in accordance with: [Number]-[Volume-optional]-[Description] Number: 2 digit level number Volume: As described in 'File Naming' Description: a concise description of the level, with underscores between words. Example 01-A-First_Floor Rooms / Spaces / Units Naming \u00b6 The following full naming convention should be used: [Level]-[Number]-[Identifier\u2013optional]\u2013[Description] Level: As described in 'File Naming' Number: In principle, the main building entrance (or the primary space when entering the facility e.g. Entrance Lobby) will be numbered 001, the initial room number. From Location 001, the process is referred to as the \u2018left hand rule method\u2019 where you would run your hand along the left hand wall of Location 001 and as soon as you enter another location (through a door) then this would be Location 002. If the room you are in has a cupboard / store located within it then this should be regarded as another Location with the appropriate number allocated. Stairwells: Stairwells should be tagged with the same room number as they are on the ground floor, or whatever floor they begin on i.e. the same Location number is used for the whole stairwell (on all floors). Lifts / Lift Shafts: Each lift and the associated Lift Shaft should be allocated a room number on the lowest floor and the same number used throughout the document on subsequent levels. If there is more than one lift (and shaft) it would have its own number. Basements / Outbuildings: When all floors from the Ground up have been tagged then the final step would be to tag the basement followed by any outbuildings on site. Identifier: Insert Text Here Description: a common or given name which represents the intended use or function of the room, with underscores between words. Multiple rooms in the same building may have identical room names, e.g Classroom. It is not necessary to differentiate them, e.g. Classroom A, Classroom B, etc. Example A-01-001-LR-Living_Room Masses Naming \u00b6 Masses are created through the \u2018Massing & Site\u2019 tab within the \u2018Conceptual Mass\u2019 panel \u2013 \u2018In-place mass\u2019. They are usually used for conceptual design to show the gross volume, gross floor area, and gross surface area of a mass or to apply walls at strange angles using \u2018apply to face\u2019. They should be named following the families naming convention. [Originator]-[Category]-[Description] Originator: As described in 'File Naming' Category: MAS for Mass Description: A short but readable description with underscores between words. If the mass is level specific add the level or zone acronym after the description i.e. 01(Fist Floor) or SB (Sports block) Example ART-MAS-Existing_Building Note They should not be named Mass 1, Mass 2 etc. There should be no duplicates of masses, the description should differentiate between them. Click here for more information about Masses from Autodesk Knowledge Network. Worksets \u00b6 Worksets should be named in a consistent and logical manner, so as to identify the owner and purpose of the workset. Each model should have a relatively small number of worksets (likely between 5 and 10) all of which should be named following the convention below. For further information on setting up 'Worksets' [Originator]-[Description] Originator: As described in 'File Naming' Description: Description of workset content; used in isolation in smaller projects, or in combination with one or both of Zone and Level on larger projects. Use underscores between words in the description. Note The two exceptions to this rule are the default \u2018Workset1\u2019 and \u2018Shared Levels and Grids\u2019 worksets. These are default worksets, are found in all projects, and shall be kept intact.

In some instances, a project specific standard may need to take precedence over this Revit standard. If so, this will be advised by the BIM Co-Ordinator on the specific project as part of the Information Management/BIM requirements.

This no longer requires users to locate the template on the server, instead, simply open Revit, go to \u2018File\u2019 \u2018New\u2019 \u2013 and select \u2018Architype Template\u2019. Architype\u2019s Revit Template is a read-only document and must not be edited by any member of staff. The template contains preloaded Detail Items, Filled Regions, View Templates, Worksets and Basic Wall/Floor/Roof Types. It also contains predefined Text Types, Line Styles and Browser Organisation. This is done to speed up the process of starting a new project and ensures that there are examples of correct naming within the project. The template will be regularly updated to ensure compliance with current BS EN ISO Standards. If a high standard view template, detail component etc, has been created which works well and may be of value to others, then contact one of Architype\u2019s Information Management team to have it inserted into the next revision of the template. Coordinate system \u00b6 All Revit models shall use a consistent and uniform coordinate system throughout the project\u2019s lifecycle to ensure information is always precisely aligned. Shared coordinates should only be acquired from a separate site model i.e. a geolocated site model should be created from a survey to share with all other disciplines. The main building is then modelled in a separate Revit file. This will make it easier for other consultants to acquire coordinates, it is also easier if the building needs to move. Attention It is important that this part of the project is carried out correctly as it can have a lasting effect on a project if done incorrectly. This should **only be done by a member of the BIM managment team.** Survey Point \u00b6 The survey point identifies a real-world location near the model, such as a corner of the project site or the intersection of 2 property lines. It defines the origin of the survey coordinate system, which provides a real-world context for the model. Project Base Point \u00b6 The project base point defines the origin (0,0,0) of the project coordinate system, used as a reference point for measurements across the site. Where there are gridlines in a project, the preference is to place the Project Base Point at the intersection of grid A-1. Internal Origin (or Start-up Location): \u00b6 The internal origin is the starting point for the internal coordinate system, which provides the basis for positioning all elements in the model. The location of the internal origin never moves. It\u2019s the origin from which the survey point (and real-world context) and project base point are established. The following table is included within Architype\u2019s standard BIM Execution Plan (BEP) \u2013 and, where we are employed as BIM Manager, this will need to be filled in by the project team at the start of the project. Project Units \u00b6 It is important to use consistent units and measurement across the project. Default project units shall be as set out in the table below: Type Symbol Units Accuracy (Decimal Places) Length mm Milimeters 0 Area m 2 Square Meters 0 Volume m 3 Cubic Meters 0 Weight Kg kilogram 0 Cost \u00a3 Pound Sterling 0 Spatial Coordinates m Meters (based on the UK Ordnance Survey National Grid Easting\u2019s and Northing\u2019s co-ordinate system) 3 Datum m Meters (based on the UK Ordnance Survey National Datum) 3 Attention Note: temporary dimensions (such as the below screenshot) will display with decimal places. Setting up the Project Browser \u00b6 Sheets \u00b6 Sheets should be organised in Revit through their numbering, sorting them into View Group & Sub View Group. For more information on numbering, see 'Number' in 'File Naming' \u2018View Group\u2019 : indicates the series number \u2018Sub View Group\u2019 : indicates the sub series number These can be found, and edited, in the properties bar of a selected sheet or view. In order to set up this organisation at the start of a project, follow the steps set out below: Views \u00b6 Revit views are categorised into: 01 Working (day-to-day working views) 02 Drawing Set (views which are on sheets) 03 Presentation (views to be taken into other pieces of software for presentation) 04 Coordination (views to assist with coordination, i.e. overlaying imported models) Tip Within '01 Working' category you can put your initials at the end of the view name to let other team members know you are working on this particular view. When you are done or no longer need the view it should be deleted. To ensure that the project browser stays as organised as possible, views from the \u201802 Drawing Set\u2019 should be placed on sheets as soon as possible. Once they are on sheets they will be automatically removed from the browser and accessed only through the sheets. This keeps the project browser tidy and makes sure that drawings are always developed in the context of a sheet. Although this process is incorporated into the Architype Template, for those working in projects already set up on previous templates, the process below can be followed. Creating a Cloud Model \u00b6 The majority of project Revit models will be stored on BIM360, certainly any project with more than one person needing access. Where this is the case, a cloud model must be created. Firstly the model is created on the Architype server, using the correct template, units and coordinates as above. It should be named correctly in accordance with 'File Naming' Secondly, the job will be set up as a project on BIM360 (this will be done by one of Architype\u2019s BIM360 admins \u2013 contact them through the Architype #revithowdoidothat Slack Channel in plenty of time). The folders outlined in 'Folder Structure' will need to be created - this can be done manually in BIM360, or the folders can be copied from an empty folder structure template onto BIM360 through As described in 'Desktop Connector' to save time. Once all of this is in place, the model should be pushed to the cloud using the \u2018collaborate\u2019 tab as shown below. Click here for more information on creating a cloud model from the Autodesk Knowledge Network. Project Information \u00b6 Starting View \u00b6 The template file contains a \u2018Starting View\u2019. This is the view which holds key project information and opens up first when you open Revit. Once in Revit, it can be found within Legends in the Project Browser. The following information must be filled in at the beginning of the project: \u2018PROJECT INFORMATION\u2019 - Number, Name, Client, User Client, Employer/Client (D&B) \u2018KEY PROJECT DATA\u2019 - Ground Floor FFL \u2018FILE INFORMATION\u2019 - \u2018File Created by\u2019 should be your company email address. - \u2018Revit version\u2019: To find out this, go to the small down arrow beside the help button at the top right of the screen \u2013 then to \u2018About Autodesk Revit\u2019 , this will open up a window containing the information relating to the version you are working in. Example Add typical example of te output for tis location here Manage \u00b6 While filling in the required information on the Starting View, the Project Location and Project Information should also be filled in. These can both be found under the \u2018Manage\u2019 tab. Project Location: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Project Location\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Location\u2019 button. The address of the site should be entered here. Project Information: \u00b6 \u2018Manage\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Settings\u2019 category \u2013 \u2018Project Information\u2019 button. Enter all known project information here. Worksets \u00b6 A workset is a collection of elements in a model. They are useful to help organise elements so members of a team can choose to display and work on selected worksets. They can be found by clicking on this icon at the bottom of the Revit window. Typically, a project is expected to include the following worksets which are set up within the Architype Revit Template Tip There will also be the Revit default \u2018Workset1\u2019 and \u2018Shared Levels and Grids\u2019 workset. These shall be kept intact. Shared Levels and Grids shall contain all Levels and Grids elements to allow for easy maintenance across the board. In order to set up new Worksets either click on the worksets icon at the bottom of the screen, or access via the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab \u2013 \u2018Manage Collaboration\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Worksets\u2019. In the Worksets dialogue click \u2018New\u2019 and enter a name (worksets must be named in accordance with protocol outlined in 'Component Naming' . To display the workset in all project views as default select \u2018Visible in all views\u2019. Clear this option if you want the workset to display only in views where you specifically turn on its visibility. Copy/Monitor Strategy for Datum Elements \u00b6 When collaborating on a project with other teams, use the Copy/Monitor tool to monitor and coordinate changes to important elements of the design. Use the Copy/Monitor tool when the following statements are true: The architectural team, the structural team, and the engineering team use Revit software. Each team must be informed of changes to levels, grids, and other elements. The teams will link models to work on the same building design. Each team maintains its own edition of the model and uses Revit software to develop the design for their discipline. Each model is linked to the other models to share information about changes to monitored elements in the building design. This will allow the other teams to control the graphical representation of datum elements within their model while maintaining correct relationship. Also, any changes to Levels and Grids in the parent model which the levels were copied from will create a warning in the model which they were copied to. Creating a single point of truth, eliminating possible errors. Under the \u2018Collaborate\u2019 tab there is a \u2018Copy/Monitor\u2019 button, select this then \u2018Select Link\u2019 and click on the link you wish to copy/monitor levels from. A new options bar will appear, select \u2018Copy\u2019, tick \u2018Multiple\u2019 then click on to the levels. Note that you must select the small finish button after clicking on each level, when that\u2019s done select the large finish button to end the process. Click here for more information on creating a cloud model from the Autodesk Knowledge Network. Adding Sheet Revisions \u00b6 All drawings which are issued from Revit will require a revision (the first time a drawing is issued it will go out as Rev 01). Nothing will ever be issued as Rev \u2013 or Rev 0. For more information refer to Section 4. To add a revision to the project, go to the \u2018View Tab\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018Sheet Composition\u2019 panel \u2013 then click \u2018Revisions\u2019. Add a revision and fill in all the required information: Date: enter the date on which the drawing will be issued Description: enter the description of the revision. This will show in the revision schedule on the sheet. Issued to: this will read as \u2018Checked\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who checked the drawing should be entered here. Issued by: this will read as \u2018Drawn\u2019 on the sheet revision schedule. The initials of the person who did the drawing, or made the revision, should be entered here. To enter a revision onto a sheet, go to the properties of the sheet and select the \u2018Edit\u2019 button beside options. This will allow you to tick the revisions you want to add to the sheet. This is how they will appear in the Titleblock:","title":"Project Setup"},{"location":"revit-standards/project-setup/#project-setup","text":"","title":"Project Setup"},{"location":"revit-standards/project-setup/#project-template","text":"Where a new project is created in Revit the most up to date version of the \u2018Architype Template\u2019 shall be used.

Note: LOCATION always at the front of the DESCRIPTION, i.e. \"LAB PARTITION\" Specifying part of DETAIL being drawn is always at end, i.e. \"SLIDING DOOR HEAD\" Typical is always at the front and written as \"TYPICAL\" MATERIAL always at end and written as \" - CONCRETE\" \"And\" or \"&\" always written as \"+\" When describing LOCATION use no space between multiples, i.e. \"LAB+LOBBY\" No abbreviations when it can be avoided, i.e. \"CURTAIN WALL\" and not \"CW\" Example: 00-100-Classroom_Layout In the WORKING views you can put you initials at the end of a drawing to let other team members know you are working on this particular view. When you are done or no longer need the view it should be removed. Refer to Section 2.4. \u2003 View Template Naming \u00b6 All views that appear on sheets should have a View Template applied. The view template should be named in accordance with: [Type]-[Scale]-[Description if applicable] Type: Choose a type from the list below. PLN Plan RCP Reflected Ceiling Plan SCT Section DTL Detail Views ELE Elevation SHE Schedules 3DI Internal 3D Views, Walkthroughs 3DE External 3D Views, Walkthroughs Scale: As applicable in format of 200, 100, 50 etc. *If the scale is not included in the template then replace with \u2018custom\u2019. All scales between 2-15 should be DTL. Description: Short description, for example \u2018General_Arrangement\u2019 \u2018Fire\u2019 or \u2018Planning\u2019, with each word separated by underscores. Always keep the description to the end so that types and scales are kept together in the list of options available. There should be no number after the name to suggest a duplicate like \u2018Planning 2\u2019. Try to limit the number of templates in a project, always check if there is a template which is already available that you can make work with your drawing before creating a new one. When naming, remember that \u2018elevation\u2019 or \u2018section\u2019 does not need to be included in the description as it is shown in the type. For example, ART-ELE-50_InternalElevations. \u2018Internal\u2019 alone is a sufficient description. Example: PLN-100-Planning Scale can be omitted when naming templates for schedules. Example: SHE-Window_Assembly. \u2003 Filter Naming \u00b6 Filters can be applied to views to alter the visibility or graphic display of elements. There can be multiple filters applied to views and including filters in view templates can apply filters to multiple views. There are two types of filters, rule-based filters and selection-based filters. Rule based filters identify elements using parameter values for selected categories. Selection-based filters identify elements that you select to isolate, hide, or apply graphic settings to the elements in the selection. When naming filters follow the below rule: [Category]-[Rule]_[Description] Category: The category that was ticked from the available list to make the filter. i.e. Walls Note Rule: A brief explanation of the rule used i.e.NameContains Description: A description of the filter rules i.e. FireProof Each section should use CamelCase where there is more than one word Example: Walls-NameContains_FireProof (All walls containing \u2018Fireproof\u2019 in the name will show in red) Walls-NameNotContain_FireProof (All walls that do not have \u2018Fireproof\u2019 in the name will show as Grey) Schedule Naming \u00b6 Schedules must be named in a presentable format as this is the title that appears on sheets. [Type]-[Level-if applicable]-[Area-if applicable]-[Working-optional] Type: What is the schedule for? Door Schedule, Floor Areas, PH Room Volumes, Sheet List etc. Level: If the schedule relates to a specific level use Ground Level, First Floor etc. If the schedule applies to the whole building, then leave this part out. Area: If the schedule relates to specific area of the building, then use the name of the area i.e. Sports Block or Nursery. If the schedule applies to the whole building, then leave this part out. Working: If a schedule is created for the purpose of editing instances and won\u2019t be shown on a sheet add \u2018Working\u2019 to the name. Examples: The following schedules are included in the Revit Template: Sheet List View List Room Schedule Legend Naming \u00b6 Legends must be named in a presentable format as this is what appears in the project browser. The title is for internal use only, so that others can locate the relevant legend when needed, the one shown on the sheet is usually written in the legend itself. Never copy/duplicate a legend and leave the name reading as \u2018copy 1\u2019. Always rename with a suitable title in accordance with: [Type]-[Description]-[Area-if applicable]_[Working-optional] Type: The type should always be first in the tile to ensure that the list is grouped by these. Choose the appropriate \u2018type\u2019 from the list below. Key A named list of symbols Legend A Key & Notes Note Notes to accompany a drawing or key Description: A concise description of what the Legend contains or where it should be used. i.e. \u2018Access_Maintenance\u2019, \u2018Window_Types\u2019, \u2018Site_Plan\u2019. Words should be separated by underscores. Area: If applicable an area can be added to the name to reference a specific part of the building. i.e. \u2018Sports Block\u2019, \u2018Nursery\u2019. The area can also be used to reference the type of drawing which the legend is for. i.e. \u2018Section\u2019. Words should be separated by underscores. Working: This section is optional. If a Legend is created but won\u2019t be shown on a sheet add Working to the name.
